- Thoughts
	- Best way to judge [[SDK]] performance? e.g. compare with logrocket?
		- We can lighthouse
		- Taiko diagnostic plugin
	- Exit criteria - this is how we are going to evaluate
		- these are the metrics we are going to look for
		- analyze the results
	- Data driven work
- Performance
	- DONE compare against logrocket, make an account on logrocket, add to perf harness, overhead computation

	- profile SDK big
	- load test with india network bandwidth (~6.5Mbps)
- DONE sdk backpressure test (5g connection), create enough load, network emulation from taiko, see if perceived spped index get affected, is visually rendering as fast as it should, 20mbps, mother's kitchen, do lots of actions after load,
